# -- Welcome!

  You have come across a cloud computing network fabric controller.  It has identified
  itself as "Quantum."  It aims to tame your (cloud) networking!
  
# -- Basics:

1) Quantum REST API: Quantum supports a REST-ful programmatic interface to manage your
   cloud networking fabric.

2) Quantum Plugins: Quantum sports a plug-able architecture that allows Quantum's REST API
   to be backed by various entities that can create a cloud-class virtual networking fabric.
   The advantages of this plug-able architecture is two-folds:
   
   a) Allows for ANY open-source project or commercial vendor to write a Quantum plug-in.
   
   b) Allows Quantum users to not be tied down to a single Quantum implementation and
      enables them to switch out a plug-in by simple editing a config file - plugins.ini
