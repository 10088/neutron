To Run:

1) On the "Openstack Controller" host:

MySQL should be installed on the host, and all plugins and clients must be
configured with access to the database.

To prep mysql, run:

mysql -u root -p -e "create database ovs_naas"

2) Edit the configuration file (src/ovs/plugins/ovs_quantum_plugin.ini)

- Make sure it matches your mysql configuration.  This file must be updated
  with the addresses and credentials to access the database.

3) Create the agent distribution tarball

$ make agent-dist

4) Copy the resulting tarball to your xenserver

5) Unpack the tarball and run install.sh.  This will install all of the
necessary pieces into /etc/xapi.d/plugins.

6) Run the agent (example below):

# /etc/xapi.d/plugins/ovs_quantum_agent.py /etc/xapi.d/plugins/ovs_quantum_plugin.ini

7) Run ovs_quantum_plugin.py via the quantum plugin framework cli.

- Edit quantum/plugins.ini to point to where the plugin and configuration
  files live

$ PYTHONPATH=$HOME/src/quantum-framework/quantum:$PYTHONPATH python quantum/cli.py

This will show all of the available commands.
